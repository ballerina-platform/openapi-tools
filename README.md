The OpenAPI Specification is a specification, which creates a RESTFUL contract for APIs detailing all of its resources 
and operations in both human and machine-readable format for easy development, discovery, and integration. Ballerina
 OpenAPI tooling will make it easy for users to start the development of a service documented in the OpenAPI contract 
  by generating the Ballerina service and client skeletons. The OpenAPI tools provide the following capabilities.
 
 1. Generate the Ballerina service or client code for a given OpenAPI definition. 
 2. Export the OpenAPI definition of a Ballerina service.
 3. Validate the service implementation of a given OpenAPI contract.
    
The `openapi` command in Ballerina is used for OpenAPI to Ballerina and Ballerina to OpenAPI code generations. 
The OpenAPI compiler plugin will allow you to validate a service implementation against an OpenAPI contract during
 compile time. 
This plugin ensures that the implementation of a service does not deviate from its OpenAPI contract.
For more information on the supported operations, go to [Using the OpenAPI Tools](https://ballerina.io/learn/openapi-tool/)
## Building from the Source

### Setting Up the Prerequisites

1. Download and install Java SE Development Kit (JDK) version 17 (from one of the following locations).

    * [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
    * [OpenJDK](https://adoptium.net/)

      > **Note:** Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the path name of the directory into which you installed JDK.
   
2. Export GitHub Personal access token with read package permissions as follows,
   ```
   export packageUser=<Username>
   export packagePAT=<Personal access token>
   ```
     
### Building the Source

Execute the commands below to build from the source.

1. To build the library:
        
        ./gradlew clean build

2. To run the integration tests:

        ./gradlew clean test

3. To build the module without the tests:

        ./gradlew clean build -x test

4. To publish to maven local:

        ./gradlew clean build publishToMavenLocal
