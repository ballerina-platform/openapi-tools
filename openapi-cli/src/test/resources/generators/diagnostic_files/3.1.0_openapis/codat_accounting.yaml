        ## Overview

        Accounts are the categories a business uses to record accounting transactions. From the Accounts endpoints, you can retrieve a list of all accounts for a specified company. 

        The categories for an account include:
          * Asset
          * Expense
          * Income
          * Liability
          * Equity.

        > **Accounts with no category**
        > 
        > If an account is pulled from the chart of accounts and its nominal code does not lie within the category layout for the company's accounts, then the **type** is `Unknown`. The **fullyQualifiedCategory** and **fullyQualifiedName** fields return `null`.
        > 
        > This approach gives a true representation of the company's accounts whilst preventing distorting financials such as a company's profit and loss and balance sheet reports.

        ## Overview

        In Codatâ€™s data model, account transactions represent bank activity within an accounting platform. All transactions that go through a bank account are recorded as account transactions.

        Account transactions are created as a result of different business activities, for example:

        * Payments: for example, receiving money for payment against an invoice.
        * Bill payments: for example, spending money for a payment against a bill.
        * Direct costs: for example, withdrawing money from a bank account, either for cash purposes or to make a payment.
        * Direct incomes: for example, selling an item directly to a contact and receiving payment at point of sale.
        * Transfers: for example, transferring money between two bank accounts.

        Account transactions is the parent data type of [payments](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Payment), [bill payments](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/BillPayment), [direct costs](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/DirectCost), [direct incomes](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/DirectIncome), and [transfers](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Transfer).

        The Aged Creditors report shows the total balance owed by a business to its suppliers over time.

        You can generate it for a company based on recently synced data from your customers' accounting platforms. The report is available in the **Reports** tab in the Codat portal.

        Total assets or liabilities are grouped into 30-day periods for each supplier, up to the current date. You can adjust the report date, period length, and number of periods to show on each report. The data can be grouped by customer or currency.

        > It is not guaranteed that write-offs are included in the Aged Creditors report.

        ## Underlying data

        The Aged Creditors report is generated from a set of required data types: [Suppliers](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Supplier), [Bills](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Bill), [Bill credit notes](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/BillCreditNote), and [Bill payments](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/BillPayment).

        To generate the report, the underlying data types must have been synced within 24 hours of each other. Otherwise an error is displayed when you try to run the report. Sync the required data types by clicking the link in the error, and then run the report again.

        > The Aged Creditor report runs based on the **issue dates** of the underlying data types rather than the due date.

        ## Accessing the Aged Creditors report in Portal

        Apart from returning the report via the API as JSON and query, you can also return the Aged Creditors report in the Codat portal.

        1. In the navigation bar, click **Companies**.
        2. Click the name of the company you want to generate the report for. The company's data page is displayed.
        3. Click the **Accounting** tab then click **Reports**.
        4. Select **Aged Creditors**.
        5. _(Optional)_ Edit the default reporting parameters.
           a. You can change the report date in the **Date** box. By default, the report includes transactions that occurred up to, but not including, today's date. To include transactions for today, enter tomorrow's date. 
           b. In the **Period Length Days** box, select the default period length for each column (the default is 30 days).
           b. In the **Number of Periods** box, enter the number of periods to show as columns in the report (the default is 4 periods).
        6. To run the report, click **Load aged creditors**.
        7. The report is generated and displayed at the bottom of the page.

        The report will be grouped per supplier and depending on the periods requested. The details indicates whether the amounts owed come from outstanding bills or bill credit notes.

        The Aged Debtors report shows the total outstanding balance due from customers to the business over time. 

        You can generate it for a company based on recently synced data from your customers' accounting platforms. The report is available in the **Reports** tab in the Codat portal.

        Total assets or liabilities are grouped into 30-day periods for each customer, up to the current date. You can adjust the report date, period length, and number of periods to show on each report. The data can be grouped by customer or currency.

        > It is not guaranteed that write-offs are included in the Aged Debtors report.

        ## Underlying data

        The Aged Debtors report is generated from a set of required data types: [Customers](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Customer), [Invoices](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Invoice), [Credit notes](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/CreditNote), and [Payments](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Payment).

        To generate the report, the underlying data types must have been synced within 24 hours of each other. Otherwise an error is displayed when you try to run the report. Sync the required data types by clicking the link in the error, and then run the report again.

        > The Aged Debtors report runs based on the **issue dates** of the underlying data types rather than the due date.

        ## Accessing the Aged Debtors report in Portal

        Apart from returning the report via the API as JSON and query, you can also return the Aged Debtors report in the Codat portal.

        1. In the navigation bar, click **Companies**.

        3. Click the **Accounting** tab then click **Reports**.
        4. Select **Aged Debtors**.
        5. _(Optional)_ Edit the default reporting parameters.
           a. You can change the report date in the **Date** box. By default, the report includes transactions that occurred up to, but not including, today's date. To include transactions for today, enter tomorrow's date. 
           b. In the **Period Length Days** box, select the default period length for each column (the default is 30 days).
           b. In the **Number of Periods** box, enter the number of periods to show as columns in the report (the default is 4 periods).
        6. To run the report, click **Load aged debtors**.
        7. The report is generated and displayed at the bottom of the page.

        The report will be grouped per supplier and depending on the periods requested. The details indicates whether the amounts owed come from outstanding invoices or credit notes.

        ## Overview

        The balance sheet is a snapshot of a company's accounts at a single point in time that provides a statement of the assets, liabilities and equity of an organization. It gives interested parties an idea of the company's financial position, in addition to displaying what the company owns and owes.

        > **Balance sheet or profit and loss report?**
        >
        > A profit and loss report summarises the total revenue, expenses, and profit or loss during a specified time period. A balance sheet report shows the financial position of a company at a specific moment in time.

        **Structure of this report**
        This report will reflect the structure and line descriptions that the business has set in their own accounting platform.

        **History**
        By default, Codat pulls (up to) 24 months of balance sheets for a company. You can adjust this to fetch more history, where available, by updating the `monthsToSync` value for `balanceSheet` on the [data type settings endpoint](https://docs.codat.io/codat-api#/operations/post-profile-syncSettings).

        **Want to pull this in a standardised structure?**
        Our [Enhanced Financials](https://docs.codat.io/assess/reports/enhanced-financials/financials) endpoints provide the same report under standardized headings, allowing you to pull it in the same format for all of your business customers.

        >

        View the coverage for bills in the <a className="external" href="https://knowledge.codat.io/supported-features/accounting?view=tab-by-data-type&dataType=bills" target="_blank">Data coverage explorer</a>.

        ## Overview

        In Codat, a bill contains details of:
        * When the bill was recorded in the accounting system.
        * How much the bill is for and the currency of the amount.
        * Who the bill was received from â€” the *supplier*.
        * What the bill is for â€” the *line items*.

        Some accounting platforms give a separate name to purchases where the payment is made immediately, such as something bought with a credit card or online payment. One example of this would be QuickBooks Online's *expenses*.

        You can find these types of transactions in our [Direct costs](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/DirectCost) data model.

        ## Overview

        A bill credit note is issued by a supplier for the purpose of recording credit. For example, if a supplier was unable to fulfil an order that was placed by a business, or delivered damaged goods, they would issue a bill credit note. A bill credit note reduces the amount a business owes to the supplier. It can be refunded to the business or used to pay off future bills.

        In the Codat API, a bill credit note is an accounts payable record issued by a [supplier](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Supplier). 

        A bill credit note includes details of:
        * The original and remaining credit.
        * Any allocations of the credit against other records, such as [bills](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Bill).
        * The supplier that issued the bill credit note.

                Currency rates in Codat are implemented as the multiple of foreign currency units to each base currency unit.  

                Where the currency rate is provided by the underlying accounting platform, it will be available from Codat with the same precision (up to a maximum of 9 decimal places). 

                For accounting platforms which do not provide an explicit currency rate, it is calculated as `baseCurrency / foreignCurrency` and will be returned to 9 decimal places.

        ## Overview

        Bill payments include all accounts payable transaction data. This includes [bills](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Bill) and [credit notes against bills](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/BillCreditNote).

        A bill payment in Codat usually represents an allocation of money within any customer accounts payable account. This includes, but is not strictly limited to:

        - A payment made against a bill â€” for example, a credit card payment, cheque payment, or cash payment.
        - An allocation of a supplier's credit note to a bill or perhaps a refund.
        - A bill payment made directly to an accounts payable account. This could be an overpayment or a prepayment, or a refund of a payment made directly to an accounts payable account.

        Depending on the bill payments which are allowed by the underlying accounting package, some of these types may be combined. Please see the example data section for samples of what these cases look like.

        In Codat, a bill payment contains details of:

        - When the bill payment was recorded in the accounting system.
        - How much it is for and in the currency.
        - Who the payment has been paid to, the _supplier_.
        - The types of bill payments, the _line items_.  

        Some accounting platforms give a separate name to purchases where the payment is made immediately, such as something bought with a credit card or online payment. One example of this would be QuickBooks Online's _expenses_. You can find these types of transactions in our [Direct costs](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/DirectCost) data model.

        Bill payments is a child data type of [account transactions](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/AccountTransaction).

        ## Bill payment types

        ### Payment of a bill

        A payment paying a single bill should have the following properties:

        - A `totalAmount` indicating the amount of the bill that was paid. This is always positive.
        - A `lines` array containing one element with the following properties:
          - An `amount` equal to the `totalAmount` above.
          - A `links` array containing one element with the following properties:
            - A `type` indicating the type of link, in this case a `Bill`.
            - An `id` containing the ID of the bill that was paid.
            - An amount of `-totalAmount` (negative `totalAmount`), indicating that the entirety of the paid amount is allocated to the bill.

        ### Payment of multiple bills

        It is possible for one payment to pay multiple bills. This can be represented using two possible formats, depending on how the supplier keeps their books:

        1. The payment has multiple entries in its **lines** array, one for each bill that is paid. Each line will follow the above example for paying a bill, and the rules detailed in the data model.
        2. The payment has a line with multiple links to each bill. This occurs when the proportion of the original payment allocated to each bill is not available.

        Each line is the same as those described above, with the **amount** indicating how much of the payment is allocated to the bill. The **amount** on the lines sum to the **totalAmount** on the payment.

        > Pushing batch payments to Xero
        > 
        > When pushing a single bill payment to Xero to pay multiple bills, only the first format is supportedâ€”multiple entries in the payment **lines** array.

        ### Payments and refunds on account

        A payment on account, that is a payment that doesnâ€™t pay a specific bill, has one entry in its lines array.

        The line has the following properties:

        - A **totalAmount** indicating the amount paid by a supplier or refunded to them by a company. A payment to the supplier is always negative. A refund is always positive.
        - A **links** array containing one element with the following properties:
          - A **type** indicating the type of link. For a payment this is `PaymentOnAccount`. For a refund this is `Refund`.
          - The **id** containing the ID of the supplier.
          - An amount for the link is `0` **totalAmount** or the amount of the payment or refund.

        It is possible to have a payment that is part on account and part allocated to a bill. Each line should follow the examples above.

        ### Using a credit note to pay a bill

        The payment of a bill using a credit note has one entry in its `lines` array. This **line** has the following properties:

        - An **amount** indicating the amount of money moved, which in this case is `0`, as the credit note and bill allocation must balance each other.
        - A **links** array containing two elements:
          - The first link has:
            - A **type** indicating the type of link, in this case a `Bill`.
            - An **id** containing the ID of the bill that was paid.
          - The second link has:
            - A **type** indicating the type of link, in this case a `CreditNote`.
            - An **id** containing the ID of the credit note used by this payment.

        The **amount** field on the **line** equals the **totalAmount** on the payment.

        ### Refunding a credit note

        A bill payment refunding a credit note has one entry in its **lines** array. This line has the following properties:

        - An **amount** indicating the amount of the credit note that was refunded. This is always negative, indicating that it is a refund.
        - A **links** array containing one element with the following properties:
          - A **type** indicating the type of `link`, in this case a `CreditNote`.
          - An **id** containing the ID of the credit note that was refunded.

        The **totalAmount** field on the payment equals the line's **amount** field. These are both negative, as this is money leaving accounts payable.

        ### Refunding a payment

        If a payment is refunded, for example, when a company overpaid a bill and the overpayment is returned, there are two payment records: 

        - One for the incoming overpayment.
        - Another for the outgoing refund.

        The payment issuing the refund is identified by the fact that the **totalAmount** is negative. This payment has one entry in its lines array that have the following properties:

        - An **amount** indicating the amount that was refunded. This is always negative.
        - A **links** array containing one element with the following properties:
          - A **type** indicating the type of a the link, in this case a `BillPayment`.
          - An **id** containing the ID of the payment that was refunded.

        The **amount** field on the line equals the **totalAmount** on the payment and is negative as this is money leaving accounts payable.

        The payment that was refunded can be identified as it has a line where the `amount` on its `line` is positive and the type of the link is `Refund`. This payment may have several entries in its **lines** array if it was partly used to pay an bill. For example, a Â£1,050 payment paying a Â£1,000 bill with a refund of Â£50 has two lines: 

        - One for Â£1,000 linked to the bill that was paid
        - Another for Â£50 linked to the payment that refunded the over payment. This link is of type `Refund` but the ID corresponds to a bill payment.

        The line linked to the bill payment has the following properties:

        - An **amount** indicating the amount that was refunded. This is positive as its money that was added to accounts payable, but is balanced out by the negative amount of the refund.
        - A **links** array containing one element with the following properties:
          - A **type** indicating the type of the link, in this case a `Refund`.
          - An **id** containing the ID of the payment that refunded this line.

        > Linked payments
        > 
        > Not all accounting packages support linked payments in this way. In these platforms you may see a payment on account and a refund on account.

        ## Foreign currencies

        There are two types of currency rate that are detailed in the bill payments data type: 

        Payment currency rate: 

        - Base currency of the accounts payable account.
        - Foreign currency of the bill payment.

        Payment line link currency rate: 

        - Base currency of the item that the link represents.
        - Foreign currency of the payment.

        These two rates allow the calculation of currency loss or gain for any of the transactions affected by the payment lines. The second rate is used when a bill payment is applied to an item in a currency that does not match either:

        - The base currency for the accounts payable account. 
        - The currency of the item.

        ## Overview

        A cash flow statement is a financial report that records all cash that is received or spent by a company during a given period. It gives you a clearer picture of the companyâ€™s performance, and their ability to pay creditors and finance growth.

        > **Cash flow statement or balance sheet?**
        > 
        > Look at the cash flow statement to understand a company's ability to pay its bills. Although the balance sheet may show healthy earnings at a specific point in time, the cash flow statement allows you to see whether the company is meeting its financial commitments, such as paying creditors or its employees.

        ## Overview

        Think of a credit note as a voucher issued to a customer. It is a reduction that can be applied against one or multiple invoices. A credit note can either reduce the amount owed or cancel out an invoice entirely.

        In the Codat system a credit note is issued to a [customer's](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Customer) accounts receivable. 

        It contains details of:
        * The amount of credit remaining and its status.
        * Payment allocations against the payments type, in this case an invoice.
        * Which customers the credit notes have been issued to.

        - - allocatedOnDate: null

        ## Overview

        A customer is a person or organisation that buys goods or services. From the Customers endpoints, you can retrieve a [list of all the customers of a company](https://api.codat.io/swagger/index.html#/Customers/get_companies__companyId__data_customers).

        Customers' data links to accounts receivable [invoices](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Invoice).

        In Codat's data model, dates and times are represented using the <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601" target="_blank">ISO 8601 standard</a>. Date and time fields are formatted as strings; for example:

        ```
        2020-10-08T22:40:50Z
        2021-01-01T00:00:00
        ```



        When syncing data that contains `DateTime` fields from Codat, make sure you support the following cases when reading time information:

        - Coordinated Universal Time (UTC): `2021-11-15T06:00:00Z`
        - Unqualified local time: `2021-11-15T01:00:00`
        - UTC time offsets: `2021-11-15T01:00:00-05:00`

        > Time zones
        > 
        > Not all dates from Codat will contain information about time zones.  
        > Where it is not available from the underlying platform, Codat will return these as times local to the business whose data has been synced.

            - `Void` - An invoice can become Void when it's deleted, refunded, written off, or cancelled. A voided invoice may still be PartiallyPaid, and so all outstanding amounts on voided invoices are removed from the accounts receivable account.

        ## Overview

        An invoice is an itemized record of goods sold or services provided to a [customer](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Customer).

        In Codat, an invoice contains details of:

        - The timeline of the invoiceâ€”when it was raised, marked as paid, last edited, and so on.
        - How much the invoice is for, what portion of the invoice is tax or discounts, and what currency the amounts are represented in. 
        - Who the invoice has been raised to; the _customer_.
        - The breakdown of what the invoice is for; the _line items_.
        - Any [payments](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Payment) assigned to the invoice; the _payment allocations_.

        > **Invoices or bills?**  
        >
        > In Codat, invoices represent accounts receivable only. For accounts payable invoices, see [Bills](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Bill).

In both platforms, the **invoiceNumber** should remain the same.

        ## Overview

        In accounting software, journals are used to record all the financial transactions of a company. Each transaction in a journal is represented by a separate [journal entry](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/JournalEntry). These entries are used to create the general ledger, which is then used to create the financial statements of a business.

        When a company records all their transactions in a single journal, it can become large and difficult to maintain and track. This is why large companies often use multiple journals (also known as subjournals) to categorize and manage journal entries.

        Such journals can be divided into two categories:

        - Special journals: journals used to record specific types of transactions; for example, a purchases journal, a sales journal, or a cash management journal.
        - General journals: journals used to record transactions that fall outside the scope of the special journals.

        Multiple journals or subjournals are used in the following Codat integrations:

        - [Sage Intacct](https://docs.codat.io/integrations/accounting/sage-intacct/accounting-sage-intacct)  (mandatory)
        - [Exact Online](https://docs.codat.io/integrations/accounting/exact-online/accounting-exact-online)  (mandatory)
        - [Oracle NetSuite](https://docs.codat.io/integrations/accounting/netsuite/accounting-netsuite) (optional)

        > When pushing journal entries to an accounting platform that doesnâ€™t support multiple journals (multi-book accounting), the entries will be linked to the platform-generic journal. The Journals data type will only include one object.

        ## Overview

        A journal entry report shows the entries made in a company's general ledger, or [accounts](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Account), when transactions are approved. The journal line items for each journal entry should balance.

        A journal entry line item is a single transaction line on the journal entry. For example: 

        - When a journal entry is recording a receipt of cash, the credit to accounts receivable and the debit to cash are separate line items. 
        - When a company needs to recognise revenue from an annual contract on a monthly basis, on receipt of cash for month one, they make a debit to deferred income and a credit to revenue.

        In Codat a journal entry contains details of:

        - The date on which the entry was created and posted.
        - Itemised lines, including amounts and currency.

        ## Overview

        Payments include all accounts receivable transaction data. This includes [invoices](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Invoice) and [credit notes](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/CreditNote).

        A payment in Codat usually represents an allocation of money within any customer accounts receivable account. This includes, but is not strictly limited to: 

        - A payment made against an invoice, like a credit card, cheque, or cash payment.
        - An allocation of a customer's credit note, either to an invoice or maybe a refund.
        - A payment made directly to that accounts receivable account. This might be an overpayment or a prepayment. It might also be the refund of a payment made directly to an accounts receivable account.

        Depending on the payments allowed by the underlying accounting package, some payment types may be combined. Please see the example for more details.

        In Codat, a payment contains details of:

        - When the payment was recorded in the accounting system.
        - How much it is for and in what currency that amount is in.
        - Who the payment was _paid by_ â€“ the _customer_.
        - The payment method used.
        - The breakdown of the types of payments â€“ the _line items_.

        Payments is a child data type of [account transactions](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/AccountTransaction).

        ## Payment types

        ## Payment of an invoice

        A payment paying a single invoice has one entry in its `lines` array. This **line** has the following properties:

        - An _amount_ that indicates the amount of the invoice that was paid. This is always positive.
        - A **links** array containing one element with the following properties:
          - A **type** that indicates the type of **link**, in this case an `Invoice`.
          - An **id** that contains the ID of the invoice that was paid.
          - An **amount** for the link. The sum of the **line.amount** and the **links.amount** must equal `0`.

        The **amount** field on the **line** equals the **totalAmount** on the payment.

        ## Payment of multiple invoices

        A single payment can pay multiple invoices. This can be represented in one of two formats depending on how the customer keeps their books:

        - The payment has multiple entries in its **lines** array, one for each invoice that is paid. Each line follows the example and rules described in [Payment of an invoice](#payment-of-an-invoice).
        - The payment has a line with multiple links to each invoice. This occurs when the proportion of the original payment allocated to each invoice is not available.

        Each **line** has the same properties as those described in [Payment of an invoice](#payment-of-an-invoice), with the **amount** indicating how much of the payment was allocated to the invoice. The sum of line amounts equals the **totalAmount** on the payment.

        ## Payments and refunds on account

        A payment on account, that is a payment that doesnâ€™t pay a specific invoice, has one entry in its lines array. The **line** has the following properties:

        - A **totalAmount** that indicates the amount paid by a customer or refunded to them by a company. A payment to the customer is always negative. A refund is always positive.
        - A **links** array containing one element with the following properties:
        - A **type** that indicates the type of link. For a payment this is `PaymentOnAccount`. For a refund this is `Refund`.
        - The **id** containing the ID of the customer.
        - The **amount** for the link is `0` â€“ the **totalAmount** _or_ the amount of the payment or refund.

        It is possible to have a payment that is part _on account_ and part _allocated_ to an invoice. Each line should follow the examples above.

        ## Using a credit note to pay an invoice

        The payment of an invoice using a credit note has one entry in its **lines** array. This **line** has the following properties:

        - An **amount** that indicates the amount of money moved, which in this case is `0`, as the credit note and invoice allocation must balance each other.
        - A **links** array containing two elements:
          - The first **link** has:
            - A **type** that indicates the type of **link**, in this case an `Invoice`.
            - An **id** that contains the ID of the invoice that was paid.
          - The second **link** has:
            - A **type** that indicates the type of **link**, in this case a `CreditNote`.
            - An **id** that contains the ID of the credit note used by this payment.

        The **amount** field on the **line** equals the **totalAmount** on the payment.

        ## Refunding a credit note

        A payment refunding a credit note has one entry in its **lines** array. This **line** has the following properties:

        - An **amount** that indicates the amount of the credit note that was refunded. This is always negative for a refund.
        - A **links** array that contains one element with the following properties:
          - A **type** that indicates the type of **link**, in this case a `CreditNote`.
          - An **id** that contains the ID of the credit note that was refunded.

        The **totalAmount** field on the payment equals the **amount** field of the **line**. These are both negative, as this is money leaving accounts receivable.

        ## Refunding a payment

        If a payment is refunded, for example, if a customer overpaid an invoice and the overpayment is returned to the customer, there are two payment records: 

        - One for the incoming over payment.
        - Another for the outgoing refund.

        The payment issuing the refund has a negative **totalAmount**. This payment also has one entry in its lines array with the following properties:

        - An **amount** that indicates the amount that was refunded. This is always negative.
        - A **links** array that contains one element with the following properties:
          - A **type** that indicates the type of **link**, in this case a `Payment`.
          - An **id** that contains the ID of the payment that was refunded.

        The **amount** field on the **line** equals the **totalAmount** on the payment and is negative, as this is money leaving accounts receivable.

        The payment that was refunded has a line where the **amount** is positive and the type of the link is `Refund`. This payment may have several entries in its **lines** array if it was used to partly pay an invoice. 

        For example: A Â£1,050 payment on a Â£1,000 invoice with a refund of Â£50 has two lines: 

        - One for Â£1,000 linked to the invoice that was paid.
        - Another for Â£50 linked to the payment that refunded the overpayment with a** type** of `Refund` and an ID that corresponds to the payment.

        The **line** linked to the payment has the following properties:

        - An **amount** that indicates the amount that was refunded. This is positive as its money that was added to accounts receivable. It's balanced out by the negative amount of the refund.
        - A **links** array containing one element with the following properties:
          - A **type** that indicates the type of **link**, in this case a `Refund`.
          - An **id** that contains the ID of the payment that refunded this line.

        > **Support for linked payments**
        > 
        > Not all accounting packages support linking payments in this way. In some platforms, you may see a payment on account and a refund on account.

        ## Foreign currencies

        There are two types of currency rate that are included in the payments data type: 

        Payment currency rate: 

        - Base currency of the accounts receivable account.
        - Foreign currency of the payment.

        Payment line link currency rate: 

        - Base currency of the item the link represents.
        - Foreign currency of the payment.

        These two rates allow the calculation of currency loss or gain for any of the transactions affected by the payment lines. The second rate is used when a payment is applied to an item in a currency that doesn't match either:

        - The base currency for the accounts receivable account. 
        - The currency of the item.

        ```json title="Currency rate example"

            "id": "123",

                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
        ```

        ## Overview

        The purpose of a profit and loss report is to present the financial performance of a company over a specified time period.

        A profit and loss report shows a company's total income and expenses for a specified period of time and whether a profit or loss has been made.

        > **Profit and loss or balance sheet?**  
        > Profit and loss reports summarise the total revenue, expenses, and profit or loss over a specified time period. A balance sheet report presents all assets, liability, and equity for a given date.


        **Structure of this report**  
        This report will reflect the structure and line descriptions that the business has set in their own accounting platform.

        **History**  
        By default, Codat pulls (up to) 24 months of profit and loss history for a company. You can adjust this to fetch more history, where available, by updating the `monthsToSync` value for `profitAndLoss` on the [data type settings endpoint](https://docs.codat.io/codat-api#/operations/post-profile-syncSettings).

        **Want to pull this in a standardised structure?**  
        Our [Enhanced Financials](https://docs.codat.io/assess/reports/enhanced-financials/financials) endpoints provide the same report under standardized headings, allowing you to pull it in the same format for all of your business customers.

        ## Overview

        Purchase orders represent a business's intent to purchase goods or services from a supplier and normally include information such as expected delivery dates and shipping details.  

        This information can be used to provide visibility on a business's expected payables and to track a purchase through the full procurement process.

        ## Overview

        A sales order represents a customer's intention to purchase goods or services from a seller and usually includes information such as the expected delivery date and shipping details. This information can be used to provide visibility on a business's expected receivables and to track sales through the full procurement process.

        A sales order is typically converted to an [invoice](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Invoice) after approval.

        ## Overview

        Accounting systems typically store a set of taxes and associated rates within the accounting package. This means that users don't have to look up or remember the rates for each type of tax. For example, applying the tax "UK sales VAT" to line items of an invoice adds the correct rate of 20%. 

        ### Tax components

        In some cases, a tax is made up of multiple sub taxes, often called _components_ of the tax.  For example, you may have an item that is charged a tax rate called "City import tax (8%)" that has two components: 

        - A city tax of 5%  
        - An import tax of 3%

        > **Effective tax rates**  
        > - Where there are multiple components of a tax, each component may be calculated on the original amount and added together. Alternatively, one tax may be calculated on the sub-total of the original amount plus another tax, which is referred to as _compounding_. When there is compounding, the effective tax rate is the rate that, if applied to the original amount, would result in the total amount of tax with compounding.

        > A tax has two components. Both components have a rate of 10%, and one component is compound. In this case, there is a total tax rate of 20% but an effective tax rate of 21%.
        >
        > - For QuickBooks Online, Codat doesn't use compound rates. Instead, the calculated effective tax rate for each component is shown. This means that the effective and total rates are the same because the total tax rate is a sum of the component rates.

        Details of a category used for tracking transactions.

        > Language tip
        >
        > Parameters used to track types of spend in various parts of an organization can be called  **dimensions**, **projects**, **classes**, or **locations** in different accounting platforms. In Codat, we refer to these as tracking categories.

        View the coverage for tracking categories in the <a className="external" href="https://knowledge.codat.io/supported-features/accounting?view=tab-by-data-type&dataType=trackingCategories" target="_blank">Data coverage explorer</a>.

        ## Overview

        Tracking categories are used to monitor cost centres and control budgets that sit outside the standard chart of accounts. Customers may use tracking categories to group together and track the income and costs of specific departments, projects, locations or customers.

        From their accounting system, customers can: 

        - Create and maintain tracking categories and tracking category types.
        - View all tracking categories that are available for use.
        - View the relationships between the categories.
        - Assign invoices, bills, credit notes, or bill credit notes to one or more categories.
        - View the categories that a transaction belongs to.
        - View all transactions in a tracking category.

        > **Example use case**
        >
        > Monitor the budget for your annual conference using a tracking category called 'AnnualConference2020' with the **type** set to **Costing**.

        If a tracking category has a parent category, the ID of that parent category is displayed. There is also a `hasChildren` field that shows whether there are child subcategories nested beneath. 
      examples:
        - hasChildren: true
          id: string
          modifiedDate: 2022-10-23T00:00:00Z

    ValidDataTypeLinks:
      description: |-
        When querying Codat's data model, some data types return `validDatatypeLinks` metadata in the JSON response. This indicates where that object can be used as a referenceâ€”a _valid link_â€”when creating or updating other data.

        For example, `validDatatypeLinks` might indicate the following references:

        - Which tax rates are valid to use on the line item of a bill.
        - Which items can be used when creating an invoice. 

        You can use `validDatatypeLinks` to present your SMB customers with only valid choices when selecting objects from a list, for example.

        ## `validDatatypeLinks` example

        The following example uses the `Accounting.Accounts` data type. It shows that, on the linked integration, this account is valid as the account on a payment or bill payment; and as the account referenced on the line item of a direct income or direct cost. Because there is no valid link to Invoices or Bills, using this account on those data types will result in an error.

        ```json validDatatypeLinks for an account
        {
                    "id": "bd9e85e0-0478-433d-ae9f-0b3c4f04bfe4",
                    "nominalCode": "090",
                    "name": "Business Bank Account",
                    #...
                    "validDatatypeLinks": [
                        {
                            "property": "Id",
                            "links": [
                                "Payment.AccountRef.Id",
                                "BillPayment.AccountRef.Id",
                                "DirectIncome.LineItems.AccountRef.Id",
                                "DirectCost.LineItems.AccountRef.Id"
                            ]
                        }
                    ]
                }
        ```



        ## Support for `validDatatypeLinks`

        Codat currently supports `validDatatypeLinks` for some data types on our Xero, QuickBooks Online, QuickBooks Desktop, Exact (NL), and Sage Business Cloud integrations. 

        If you'd like us to extend support to more data types or integrations, suggest or vote for this on our <a href="https://portal.productboard.com/codat/5-product-roadmap">Product Roadmap</a>.
