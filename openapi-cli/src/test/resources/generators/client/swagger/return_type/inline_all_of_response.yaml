                    To set time as GMT the format should be `yyyy-MM-dd`T`HH:mm:ssZ`. Example: "2020-03-31T12:02:00Z"

You can also set the time as UTC as the timezone field.


                    The `start_time` should only be used for scheduled and / or recurring webinars with fixed time.

                              Use this field **only if you're scheduling a recurring meeting of
                              type** `3` to state which day in a month, the
                              meeting should recur. The value range is from 1 to
                              31.


                              For instance, if you would like the meeting to recur on 23rd of each month, provide `23` as the value of this field and `1` as the value of the `repeat_interval` field. Instead, if you would like the meeting to recur every three months, on 23rd of the month, change the value of the `repeat_interval` field to `3`.
