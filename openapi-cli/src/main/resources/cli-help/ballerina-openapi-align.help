                         [--exclude <align-type-names>]

DESCRIPTION
       Align the OpenAPI contract file according to the best practices of Ballerina.

       By default, the following alignments are done:
       - `name`: Align according to the best naming practices of Ballerina. The Ballerina
       name extensions are added to the schemas which can not be modified directly.
       - `doc`: Align according to the best documentation practices of Ballerina.
       - `basepath`: Extract the common base path from the operations and add it to the
       server url.

       The alignments can be filtered using the `--include` and `--exclude` options.
       The `--include` option has higher priority than the `--exclude` option.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
            Print help information about the `bal openapi align` command.

       -i, --input <openapi-contract-file-path>
            This is a mandatory input. The given OpenAPI contract will be aligned.
            The OpenAPI contract can be either a YAML or a JSON.

       -o, --output <output-file-path>
            This is an optional input. The given output file path will be used to
            save the aligned OpenAPI contract. The default output file path is
            the executed directory.

       -n, --name <generated-file-name>
            This is an optional input. The given name will be used to save the
            aligned OpenAPI contract. The default name is `aligned_ballerina_openapi`.

       -f, --format [json|yaml]
            This is an optional input. The aligned OpenAPI contract will be
            saved in the given format. The format can be either JSON or YAML.
            The default format is same as the input file format.

       -t, --tags <tag-names>
            This is an optional input. The aligned OpenAPI contract will only
            have the operations with the given tags.

       --operations <operation-names>
            This is an optional input. The aligned OpenAPI contract will only
            have the given operations.

       --include <align-type-names>
            This is an optional input. The aligned OpenAPI contract will only
            have the given alignments. The supported alignments are: `name`,
            `doc` and `basepath`.

       --exclude <align-type-names>
            This is an optional input. The aligned OpenAPI contract will not
            have the given alignments. The supported alignments are: `name`,
            `doc`and `basepath`. The `--include` option has higher priority than
            the `--exclude` option.

EXAMPLES
       Align the `service.yaml` OpenAPI contract file.
           $ bal openapi align -i service.yaml

       Align the `service.yaml` OpenAPI contract file and save it as
       `aligned_svc.json` file.
           $ bal openapi align -i hello.yaml -n aligned_svc -f json

       Align the `service.json` OpenAPI contract file by filtering the
       operations with the `service` tag.
           $ bal openapi align -i service.json -t service

       Align the `service.json` OpenAPI contract with only the `name` alignment.
           $ bal openapi align -i service.json --include name
