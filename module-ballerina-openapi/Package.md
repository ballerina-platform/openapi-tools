## Package Overview

The `openapi` package is one of the command-line tools of the [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/) language.

This package provides support for the Ballerina OpenAPI tooling. The OpenAPI commands will make it easy to 
start the development of a service documented in an OpenAPI contract in Ballerina by generating the Ballerina service 
and client skeletons and exporting the OpenAPI definition of a Ballerina service. The OpenAPI compiler plugin will 
allow you to validate a service implementation against an OpenAPI contract during the compile time. This plugin  
ensures that the implementation of a service does not deviate from its OpenAPI contract.
